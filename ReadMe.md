
# Introduction

VDS.Common is a lightweight, dependency-free library of useful advanced data structures such as Trees, Tries and indexing tailored dictionaries.

It is based on code originally from in the [dotNetRDF Project][1] (see past code history [here][2] and [here][3]) but was split off into a separate library once it became sufficiently generic to be more broadly useful.

VDS.Common is built for a variety of .Net versions and profiles, currently we have builds for the following:

- .Net 3.5 Full/Client Profile
- .Net 4.0 Full/Client Profile
- Portable Class Library Profile 328
- .NET Core netstandard1.0
- .NET Core netstandard1.4
- .NET Core netstandard2.0
